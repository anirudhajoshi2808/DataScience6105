    "We now know how to use analytical parametric pdfs with known properties, and to match them with empirical data in order to zero in on the right parameters. It involves a bit of math (MOM), or a lot of math (MLE) for better estimates. The parameters are **point estimates**, the **data model** is **frequentist**, and we have little idea of the error we're making. The KS test does give us an idea, but how do we know where to draw the line on the p-value?\n",

    "### Bayesian vs Frequentist Statistics: *What's the difference?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Any* statistical inference scheme, Bayesian or otherwise, involves at least the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some **unknown quantities**, which we are interested in learning or predicting. These are called the **dependent variables**\n",
    "2. Some **data** which have been observed, and hopefully contains information leading to the dependent variables. These are called the **independent variables**. Note that some of these may be **correlated** with themselves (linearly or not), so we should be able to throw the correlated ones and only use the ***really independent variables*** for predicting the dependent ones\n",
    "3. One (or more) **models** that relate the independent variables to the dependent variables via a probablity distribution function (pdf). The pdf will yield **variates** that essentialy statistically ***look like the real data***. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is the instrument you use to **learn** about the underlying process that yields the data. For example, you learn about the real world from the model that your parents build for you then teach you, before you leave home to build your own models. Machines build models to learn, too. They either learn them from the data, or we (humans) can also teach them the model, like parents to them! For example, we have meteorological models, which predict weather.\n",

    "In a **Frequentist** world view, **data** observed is considered **random**, because it is the realization of random processes and hence will vary each time one goes to observe the system. Model **parameters** are considered **fixed**. A parameter's true value may be as of yet unknown, but it's fixed. You need to wait till you have *all the data* before you can use methods to evaluate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Max Verstappen's probability of winning is fixed for the season. That's what you did in your homework. Jesus Christ is a central parameter in the Christian World Model. Christians will say the world order may be random because of human misgivings, but Jesus Christ and his compassion (the parameter) is fixed and steadfast.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a frequentist world view, we take the winning scores of Lewis Hamilton from last season, and use these parameters as the ground truth for probabilities of wins this season. The wins may not match predictions, but that is because the world is **random**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **Bayesian** world view,  *data* is considered **fixed**. Model parameters are **random** and treated as probability distributions. Model parameters *change all the time*, and as soon as you observe new evidence, you need to re-evaluate them!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we need to reevaluate Max Verstappen's probability of winning *after every race*. I'm sur eyou felt that, too, when you did your homework. some Christians may postulate that world order is predetermined, however Jesus Christ's compassion may vary because.. *sometimes he gets exasperated by his followers*!\n",
    "\n",
    "This religious analogy is *mine*, so if it's not very good, I apologize in advance! In my simple mind, it helps me understand what is *fixed*, and what is *variable*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Bayesian world view, the world is not random: There is a perfect scientific explanation for everything. However, the probabilities for MV winning a race ***changes*** after every race. Sometimes he's on a winning streak, and other times on a losing streak."

    "## The Student-T distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm... there appears to be extreme (\"outlier\") values in the data (bins on the left and/or right that are distant from where most of the data lies, we say the data \"*has wings*). That is a good indicator to pick a new pdf from our catalogue of all possible pdfs, called the [Student-t](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) distribution, to describe the distributions of the scores in each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was developed by [William Sealy Gosset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset) under the pseudonym `Student`. That's because William worked for Guiness, and Guiness was very worried about its secret Beer formula. Another researcher at Guinness had previously published a paper containing trade secrets of the Guinness brewery. To prevent further disclosure of confidential information, Guinness prohibited its employees from publishing any papers regardless of the contained information. So William published his results with a pseudonym. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another researcher, [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) introduced a new form of that statistic, denoted `t`. The t-form was adopted because it fit in with Fisher's theory of degrees of freedom. And so now we're stuck with the mysteriously-named `Student-t` distribution, which works great modeling histograms ***with outliers*** (like financial data!).\n",
    "\n",
    "</br >\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"ipynb.images/guiness.jpg\" width=200 />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This sampling distribution adds **robustness** to the analysis, as a `T distribution` is less sensitive to outlier observations, relative to a `normal` distribution. In other words, if you have ***a lot of outliers*** in your data and attempt to model your data with a normal distribution, your outliers will *skew* your model so that it does not fit the non-outlier data very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **three-parameter** Student-t distribution allows for the specification of the following $\\theta$s: A mean $\\mu$, a precision (inverse-variance) $\\lambda$, and a degrees-of-freedom parameter $\\nu$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x\\;|\\;\\mu,\\lambda,\\nu) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac{\\nu + 1}{2})}{\\Gamma(\\frac{\\nu}{2})} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi\\nu}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\left[1+\\frac{\\lambda(x-\\mu)^2}{\\nu}\\right]^{-\\frac{\\nu+1}{2}}$$\n",
    "           \n",
    "where $\\Gamma$ denotes the [Gamma function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function), an extension of the factorial function (with its argument shifted down by 1) to real and complex numbers, and not to be confused with the (lower-case) maximum entropy [$\\gamma$ distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution) used to model rainfalls and insurance claims. This class will, if anything, teach you the greek alphabet!\n",
    "\n",
    "The degrees-of-freedom parameter essentially specifies the \"***normality***\" of the data, since larger values of $\\nu$ make the distribution converge to a normal distribution, while small values (close to zero) result in heavier tails.\n",

    "Now, draw 10,000 samples from a Student-T distribution (`StudentT` in PyMC3) with parameter `nu=3` and compare the distribution of these values to a similar number of draws from a `Normal` distribution with parameters `mu=0` and `sd=1`. The distribution is denoted `StudentT` in `pymc3`, while the normal distribution is denoted by `Normal`. So, `StudentT.dist(nu=3)` and `Normal.dist(0,1)`. Getting a random sampling of 10,000 datapoints can be achieved with `.random(size=10000)`. Plot with `seaborn` using `.distplot()`, from -10 to 10. You should find that the Student-T is more spread out and has a lower peak than the Gaussian. Import the Student-T distribution and the Normal distribution from pymc3: `from pymc3 import StudentT, Normal`. Then, draw 10,000 random variates from Student-T: `StudentT.dist(nu=3).random(size=10000)`, and 10,000 random variates from a gaussian: `Normal.dist(0,1).random(size=10000)`. Use `seagram` to plot both histograms on top of each other."

    "Introducing PyMC3\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "`PyMC3` is a Python library for programming Bayesian analysis; see [here](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.55). It's a wonderful package. Looky [here](https://docs.pymc.io/) for its API and docs. It helps us solve tough inverse problems and extract a model from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model our problem using PyMC3. This type of programming is called ***probabilistic programming***, and it is probabilistic in that we create probability models using programming variables as the model's components. Model components are first-class primitives within the PyMC3 framework. \n",
    "\n",
    ">   Another way of thinking about this: unlike a traditional program, which only runs in the forward direction, a probabilistic program runs in ***both*** forward and backward directions. It runs forward to compute consequences of assumptions it contains about the model, but also backward from the data to constrain possible explanations. In practice, many probabilistic programming systems will cleverly interleave forward and backward operations to efficiently home in on the best explanations.  - [Cronin, Beau. \"Why Probabilistic Programming Matters.\" 24 Mar 2013. Google, Online Posting to Google . Web. 24 Mar. 2013]( https://plus.google.com/u/0/107971134877020469960/posts/KpeRdJKR6Z1)\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC3 used to rely on [**theano**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theano_(software)), a Python library that allows one to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently, and which we will revisit when we focus on machine learning. Theano is the brainchild of [Yoshua Benjio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio) of the University of Montreal's [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) laboratory. In my opinion, it's the most famous university lab associated to artificial neural networks and deep learning. It's pretty [well-funded](http://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2017/09/15/facebook-invests-over-7m-u.s.-in-mila-and-ai-research-in-montreal/).\n",
    "\n",
    "`theano` is now deprecated because other libraries like facebook's `Torch` and Google's `TensorFlow` now include the same features. Older PyMC3 versions still uses theano, but the newer versions don't, they use [**tensorflow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "For probabilistic programming, you write a program in Python that builds expressions for Theano. You still have to declare variables $a,b,c$ and give their types $(int, int, int)$, build expressions for how to put those variables together $a^b + c$, and compile expression graphs to functions $Pow(a,b,c)$ in order to use them for computation. What theano builds in return is a super-fast callable object from a purely symbolic graph, optimizes the graph, and even compiles some or all of it into native machine instructions. More on Theano [here](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/). \n",
    "\n",
    "For older theano versions of PyMC3, we needed to do this (don't do this if you're using a new version):\n",
    "- On Windows, from the Start menu, search for and open `Anaconda Prompt`. On MacOS, open Launchpad, then click the Terminal icon. On Linux, open a Terminal window. Now in these windows, type `conda install -c mila-udem theano pygpu`. Don't try `!conda install theano` in a jupyter notebook code cell because it may fry your jupyter notebook's kernel. Wait until success. Then in that same terminal, type `conda install pymc3`. Wait until success.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC3 code is easy to read. The only novel thing is the syntax. Simply remember that we are representing the model's components ($\\tau, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ ) as **probabilistic variables**. And the way we represent *continuous* probabilistic variables is with a probability density function (pdf): A **function**, not a **dictionary** anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note**: Do not confuse this/these function/s with the histogram of the dataset or the pdf that we will use to model it. That is a *different* function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out these functions, we will first assume they have a certain shape, which we will call the **prior shape**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will run a simulation and try to approximate our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow us to refine the prior shapes into **posterior shapes**, in accordance with Bayes' theorem."
